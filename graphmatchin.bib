abstract = {A Lagrangian relaxation network for graph matching is presented. The problem is formulated as follows: given graphs G and g, find a permutation matrix M that brings the two sets of vertices into correspondence. Permutation matrix constraints are formulated in the framework of deterministic annealing. Our approach is in the same spirit as a Lagrangian decomposition approach in that the row and column constraints are satisfied separately with a Lagrange multiplier used to equate the two "solutions". Due to the unavoidable symmetries in graph isomorphism (resulting in multiple global minima), we add a symmetry-breaking self-amplification term in order to obtain a permutation matrix. With the application of a fixpoint preserving algebraic transformation to both the distance measure and self-amplification terms, we obtain a Lagrangian relaxation network. The network performs minimization with respect to the Lagrange parameters and maximization with respect to the permutation matrix variables. Simulation results are shown on 100 node random graphs and for a wide range of connectivities.},

abstract = {Loopy belief propagation has been employed in a wide variety of applications with great empirical success, but it comes with few theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the max-product form of belief propagation for the weighted matching problem on general graphs. We show that the performance of max-product is exactly characterized by the natural linear programming (LP) relaxation of the problem. In particular, we first show that if the LP relaxation has no fractional optima then max-product always converges to the correct answer. This establishes the extension of the recent result by Bayati, Shah and Sharma, which considered bipartite graphs, to general graphs. Perhaps more interestingly, we also establish a tight converse, namely that the presence of any fractional LP optimum implies that max-product will fail to yield useful estimates on some of the edges. We extend our results to the weighted b-matching and r -edge-cover problems. We also demonstrate how to simplify the max-product message-update equations for weighted matching, making it easily deployable in distributed settings like wireless or sensor networks.},

abstract = {A graduated assignment algorithm for graph matching is presented which is fast and accurate even in the presence of high noise. By combining graduated nonconvexity, two-way (assignment) constraints, and sparsity, large improvements in accuracy and speed are achieved. Its low order computational complexity [O(lm), where l and m are the number of links in the two graphs] and robustness in the presence of noise offer advantages over traditional combinatorial approaches. The algorithm, not restricted to any special class of graph, is applied to subgraph isomorphism, weighted graph matching, and attributed relational graph matching. To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, attributed relational graphs derived from objects are matched. Then, results from twenty-five thousand experiments conducted on 100 mode random graphs of varying types (graphs with only zero-one links, weighted graphs, and graphs with node attributes and multiple link types) are reported. No comparable results have been reported by any other graph matching algorithm before in the research literature. Twenty-five hundred control experiments are conducted using a relaxation labeling algorithm and large improvements in accuracy are demonstrated},

abstract = {We propose a convex-concave programming approach for the labeled weighted graph matching problem. The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained by rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on the set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization problems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on the set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We, therefore, construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore, perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four data sets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images, and handwritten Chinese characters. In all cases, the results are competitive with the state of the art.},

A general formulation for editing graphs is used to derive a graph edit distance that is proven to be a metric, provided the cost function for individual edit operations is a metric. Then, a binary linear program is developed for computing this graph edit distance, and polynomial time methods for determining upper and lower bounds on the solution of the binary program are derived by applying solution methods for standard linear programming and the assignment problem. A recognition problem of comparing a sample input graph to a database of known prototype graphs in the context of a chemical information system is presented as an application of the new method. The costs associated with various edit operations are chosen by using a minimum normalized variance criterion applied to pairwise distances between nearest neighbors in the database of prototypes. The new metric is shown to perform quite well in comparison to existing metrics when applied to a database of chemical graphs.},

abstract = {A convenient way of dealing with image sets is to represent them as points on Grassmannian manifolds. While several recent studies explored the applicability of discriminant analysis on such manifolds, the conventional formalism of discriminant analysis suffers from not considering the local structure of the data. We propose a discriminant analysis approach on Grassmannian manifolds, based on a graph-embedding framework. We show that by introducing within-class and between-class similarity graphs to characterise intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, the geometrical structure of data can be exploited. Experiments on several image datasets (PIE, BANCA, MoBo, ETH-80) show that the proposed algorithm obtains considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to three recent methods: Grassmann Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Kernel GDA, and the kernel version of Affine Hull Image Set Distance. We further propose a Grassmannian kernel, based on canonical correlation between subspaces, which can increase discrimination accuracy when used in combination with previous Grassmannian kernels.},

Although there have been a number of attempts to realise graph matching in this way, in this paper we propose a novel information-theoretic measure of alignment, the so-called symmetrized normalized-entropy-square variation. We successfully test this dissimilarity measure between manifolds on a a challenging database. The measure is estimated by means of the bypass Leonenko entropy functional. In addition we prove that the proposed measure induces a positive definite kernel between the probability density functions associated with the manifolds and hence between graphs after deformation. In our experiments we find that the optimal embedding is associated to the commute time distance and we also find that our approach, which is purely topological, outperforms several state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms for point matching.},

abstract = {Graph theory is a valuable framework to study the organization of functional and anatomical connections in the brain. Its use for comparing network topologies, however, is not without difficulties. Graph measures may be influenced by the number of nodes (N) and the average degree (k) of the network. The explicit form of that influence depends on the type of network topology, which is usually unknown for experimental data. Direct comparisons of graph measures between empirical networks with different N and/or k can therefore yield spurious results. We list benefits and pitfalls of various approaches that intend to overcome these difficulties. We discuss the initial graph definition of unweighted graphs via fixed thresholds, average degrees or edge densities, and the use of weighted graphs. For instance, choosing a threshold to fix N and k does eliminate size and density effects but may lead to modifications of the network by enforcing (ignoring) non-significant (significant) connections. Opposed to fixing N and k, graph measures are often normalized via random surrogates but, in fact, this may even increase the sensitivity to differences in N and k for the commonly used clustering coefficient and small-world index. To avoid such a bias we tried to estimate the N,k-dependence for empirical networks, which can serve to correct for size effects, if successful. We also add a number of methods used in social sciences that build on statistics of local network structures including exponential random graph models and motif counting. We show that none of the here-investigated methods allows for a reliable and fully unbiased comparison, but some perform better than others.},

In the special case where GA = GB = G, the matrix S is square and the score sij is the similarity score between the vertices i and j of G.

We propose a measure of similarity based on the concept that two vertices are similar if their immediate neighbors in the network are themselves similar. This leads to a self-consistent matrix formulation of similarity that can be evaluated iteratively using only a knowledge of the adjacency matrix of the network. We test our similarity measure on computer-generated networks for which the expected results are known, and on a number of real-world networks.},

abstract = {Network querying is a growing domain with vast applications ranging from screening compounds against a database of known molecules to matching subnetworks across species. Graph indexing is a powerful method for searching for queries in a large database of graphs. Most graph indexing methods to date tackle the exact matching (isomorphism) problem, limiting their applicability to specific instances in which such matches exist. Here we provide a novel graph indexing method to cope with the more general, inexact matching problem. Our method, SIGMA, builds on approximating a new variant of the set-cover problem that concerns overlapping multi-sets. We extensively test our method and compare it to a layman approach and to the state-of-the-art Grafil. We show that SIGMA outperforms both, providing higher pruning power in all the tested scenarios. 1.},

abstract = {The graph is an essential data structure for representing relational information. When graphs are used to represent objects, comparing objects amounts to graph matching. Inexact graph matching is the process of finding the best possible matching between two graphs when exact matching is impossible. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the inexact matchingproblem. The new algorithm decomposes the matching process into K phases, where the value of K ranges from 1 to the minimum of the numbers of nodes in the two graphs to be matched. The efficiency of the new algorithm results from the use of small values of K,significantly reducing the search space while still producing very good matchings (most of them optimal) between graphs. The algorithm is compared with the error-correcting subgraph isomorphism algorithm based on A.},

abstract = {The structure and connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system has a total complement of 302 neurons, which are arranged in an essentially invariant structure. Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

Based on this analysis we derive a ranking scheme for spectral matchings based on their reliability, and propose a novel iterative probabilistic matching algorithm that relaxes some of the implicit assumption used in prior works.

Among these characteristics are the presence of a very large strongly connected component in each of the corresponding directed graphs, the complete absence of any clear power laws describing the distribution of local features, and the rise to prominence of some local features (e.g., stress centrality) that can be used to effectively search for keywords in the libraries.},

abstract = {Consider an attributed graph whose vertices are colored green or red, but only a few are observed to be red. The color of the other vertices is unobserved. Typically, the unknown total number of red vertices is small. The vertex nomination problem is to nominate one of the unobserved vertices as being red. The edge set of the graph is a subset of the set of unordered pairs of vertices. Suppose that each edge is also colored green or red and this is observed for all edges. The context statistic of a vertex is defined as the number of observed red vertices connected to it, and its content statistic is the number of red edges incident to it. Assuming that these statistics are independent between vertices and that red edges are more likely between red vertices, Coppersmith and Priebe (2012) proposed a likelihood model based on these statistics. Here, we formulate a Bayesian model using the proposed likelihood together with prior distributions chosen for the unknown parameters and unobserved vertex colors. From the resulting posterior distribution, the nominated vertex is the one with the highest posterior probability of being red. Inference is conducted using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm, and performance is illustrated by a simulation study. Results show that (i) the Bayesian model performs significantly better than chance; (ii) the probability of correct nomination increases with increasing posterior probability that the nominated vertex is red; and (iii) the Bayesian model either matches or performs better than the method in Coppersmith and Priebe. An application example is provided using the Enron email corpus, where vertices represent Enron employees and their associates, observed red vertices are known fraudsters, red edges represent email communications perceived as fraudulent, and we wish to identify one of the latent vertices as most likely to be a fraudster.},

Previous graph matching algorithms suffer from high computational complexity and therefore do not have good scalability with respect to graph size. For matching two weighted graphs of \$n\$ nodes, our algorithm has time complexity only \$O(n\^{}3)\$ per iteration and space complexity \$O(n\^{}2)\$. In addition to its scalability, our algorithm is easy to implement, robust, and able to match undirected weighted attributed graphs of different sizes. While the convergence rate of previous iterative graph matching algorithms is unknown, our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge at a linear rate. Extensive experiments on large synthetic and real graphs (more than 1,000 nodes) were conducted to evaluate the performance of various algorithms. Results show that in most cases our proposed algorithm achieves better performance than previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy in large graph matching. In particular, with high accuracy, our algorithm takes only a few seconds (in a PC) to match two graphs of 1,000 nodes.},

In the age of big data, graph valued data is becoming more prominent, and with it, a desire to run algorithms on ever larger graphs. Because QAP is NP-hard, exact algorithms are intractable. Approximate algorithms necessarily employ an accuracy/efficiency trade-off. We developed a fast approximate quadratic assignment algorithm (FAQ). FAQ finds a local optima in (worst case) time cubic in the number of vertices, similar to other approximate QAP algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm is faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80\% of the suite of QAP benchmarks, compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying the algorithms to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes (brain-graphs), we find that FAQ achieves the optimal performance in record time, whereas none of the others even find the optimum.},

abstract = {Graph inference is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. Given two graphs on the same number of vertices, the graph matching problem is to find a bijection between the two vertex sets which minimizes the number of adjacency disagreements between the two graphs. The seeded graph matching problem is the graph matching problem with an additional constraint that the bijection assigns some particular vertices of one vertex set to respective particular vertices of the other vertex set. Solving the (seeded) graph matching problem will enable methodologies for many graph inference tasks, but the problem is NP-hard. We modify the state-of-the-art approximate graph matching algorithm of Vogelstein et al. (2012) to make it a fast approximate seeded graph matching algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm - and the potential for dramatic performance improvement from incorporating just a few seeds - via simulation and real data experiments.},

abstract = {We study the consistency of graph matching for estimating a latent alignment function between the vertex sets of two graphs, as well as subsequent algorithmic implications when the latent alignment is partially observed. In the correlated Erdos-Renyi graph setting, we prove that graph matching provides a strongly consistent estimate of the latent alignment in the presence of even modest correlation. We then investigate a tractable, restricted-focus version of graph matching, which is only concerned with adjacency involving vertices in a partial observation of the latent alignment; we prove that a logarithmic number of vertices in the known partial latent alignment is sufficient for this restricted-focus version of graph matching to yield a strongly consistent estimate of the latent alignment of the remaining vertices. Lastly, we show how Frank-Wolfe methodology for approximate graph matching, when there is a known partial latent alignment, inherently incorporates this restricted-focus graph matching.},

@article{Liu2014,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a concavely regularized convex relaxation based graph matching algorithm. The graph matching problem is firstly formulated as a constrained convex quadratic program by relaxing the feasible set from the permutation matrices to doubly stochastic matrices. To gradually push the doubly stochastic matrix back to be a permutation one, an objective function is constructed by adding a simple weighted concave regularization to the convex relaxation. By gradually increasing the weight of the concave term, minimization of the objective function will gradually push the doubly stochastic matrix back to be a permutation one. A concave–convex procedure (CCCP) together with the Frank–Wolfe algorithm is adopted to minimize the objective function. The algorithm can be used on any types of graphs and exhibits a comparable performance as the PATH following algorithm, a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm but applicable only on undirected graphs.},

@article{Aflalo2014,
abstract = {We consider the problem of exact and inexact matching of weighted undirected graphs, in which a bijective correspondence is sought to minimize a quadratic weight disagreement. This NP-hard problem is often relaxed as a convex quadratic program, in which the space of permutations is replaced by the space of doubly-stochastic matrices. However, the applicability of such a relaxation is poorly understood. We define a broad class of friendly graphs characterized by an easily verifiable spectral property. We prove that for friendly graphs, the convex relaxation is guaranteed to find the exact isomorphism or certify its inexistence. This result is further extended to approximately isomorphic graphs, for which we develop an explicit bound on the amount of weight disagreement under which the relaxation is guaranteed to find the globally optimal approximate isomorphism. We also show that in many cases, the graph matching problem can be further harmlessly relaxed to a convex quadratic program with only n separable linear equality constraints, which is substantially more efficient than the standard relaxation involving 2n equality and n\^{}2 inequality constraints. Finally, we show that both convex relaxations are generally unsuitable for matching symmetric graphs.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {This paper explores combinatorial optimization for problems of max-weight graph matching on multi-partite graphs, which arise in integrating multiple data sources. Entity resolution-the data integration problem of performing noisy joins on structured data-typically proceeds by first hashing each record into zero or more blocks, scoring pairs of records that are co-blocked for similarity, and then matching pairs of sufficient similarity. In the most common case of matching two sources, it is often desirable for the final matching to be one-to-one (a record may be matched with at most one other); members of the database and statistical record linkage communities accomplish such matchings in the final stage by weighted bipartite graph matching on similarity scores. Such matchings are intuitively appealing: they leverage a natural global property of many real-world entity stores-that of being nearly deduped-and are known to provide significant improvements to precision and recall. Unfortunately unlike the bipartite case, exact max-weight matching on multi-partite graphs is known to be NP-hard. Our two-fold algorithmic contributions approximate multi-partite max-weight matching: our first algorithm borrows optimization techniques common to Bayesian probabilistic inference; our second is a greedy approximation algorithm. In addition to a theoretical guarantee on the latter, we present comparisons on a real-world ER problem from Bing significantly larger than typically found in the literature, publication data, and on a series of synthetic problems. Our results quantify significant improvements due to exploiting multiple sources, which are made possible by global one-to-one constraints linking otherwise independent matching sub-problems. We also discover that our algorithms are complementary: one being much more robust under noise, and the other being simple to implement and very fast to run.},

@article{Lyzinski2014,
abstract = {Graph matching---aligning a pair of graphs to minimize their edge disagreements---has received wide-spread attention from both theoretical and applied communities over the past several decades, including combinatorics, computer vision, and connectomics. Its attention can be partially attributed to its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.},
