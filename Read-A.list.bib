abstract = {Latent Variable Models, such as the GPLVM and related methods, help mitigate overfitting when learning from small or moderately sized training sets. Nevertheless, existing methods suffer from several problems: 1) complexity; 2) the lack of explicit mappings to and from the latent space; 3) an inability to cope with multi-modality; and 4) the lack of a well-defined density over the latent space. We propose a LVM called the Kernel Information Embedding (KIE) that defines a coherent joint density over the input and a learned latent space. Learning is quadratic, and it works well on small datasets. We also introduce a generalization, the shared KIE (sKIE), that allows us to model multiple input spaces (e.g., image features and poses) using a single, shared latent representation. KIE and sKIE permit missing data during inference, and partially labelled data during learning. We show that with datasets too large to learn a coherent global model, one can use the sKIE to learn local online models. We use sKIE for human pose inference.},

abstract = {Techniques for multidimensional scaling visualize objects as points in a low-dimensional metric map. As a result, the visualizations are subject to the fundamental limitations of metric spaces. These limitations prevent multidimensional scaling from faithfully representing non-metric similarity data such as word associations or event co-occurrences. In particular, multidimensional scaling cannot faithfully represent intransitive pairwise similarities in a visualization, and it cannot faithfully visualize “central” objects. In this paper, we present an extension of a recently proposed multidimensional scaling technique called t-SNE. The extension aims to address the problems of traditional multidimensional scaling techniques when these techniques are used to visualize non-metric similarities. The new technique, called multiple maps t-SNE, alleviates these problems by constructing a collection of maps that reveal complementary structure in the similarity data. We apply multiple maps t-SNE to a large data set of word association data and to a data set of NIPS co-authorships, demonstrating its ability to successfully visualize non-metric similarities.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a concavely regularized convex relaxation based graph matching algorithm. The graph matching problem is firstly formulated as a constrained convex quadratic program by relaxing the feasible set from the permutation matrices to doubly stochastic matrices. To gradually push the doubly stochastic matrix back to be a permutation one, an objective function is constructed by adding a simple weighted concave regularization to the convex relaxation. By gradually increasing the weight of the concave term, minimization of the objective function will gradually push the doubly stochastic matrix back to be a permutation one. A concave–convex procedure (CCCP) together with the Frank–Wolfe algorithm is adopted to minimize the objective function. The algorithm can be used on any types of graphs and exhibits a comparable performance as the PATH following algorithm, a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm but applicable only on undirected graphs.},

@article{Aflalo2014,
abstract = {We consider the problem of exact and inexact matching of weighted undirected graphs, in which a bijective correspondence is sought to minimize a quadratic weight disagreement. This NP-hard problem is often relaxed as a convex quadratic program, in which the space of permutations is replaced by the space of doubly-stochastic matrices. However, the applicability of such a relaxation is poorly understood. We define a broad class of friendly graphs characterized by an easily verifiable spectral property. We prove that for friendly graphs, the convex relaxation is guaranteed to find the exact isomorphism or certify its inexistence. This result is further extended to approximately isomorphic graphs, for which we develop an explicit bound on the amount of weight disagreement under which the relaxation is guaranteed to find the globally optimal approximate isomorphism. We also show that in many cases, the graph matching problem can be further harmlessly relaxed to a convex quadratic program with only n separable linear equality constraints, which is substantially more efficient than the standard relaxation involving 2n equality and n\^{}2 inequality constraints. Finally, we show that both convex relaxations are generally unsuitable for matching symmetric graphs.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {This paper explores combinatorial optimization for problems of max-weight graph matching on multi-partite graphs, which arise in integrating multiple data sources. Entity resolution-the data integration problem of performing noisy joins on structured data-typically proceeds by first hashing each record into zero or more blocks, scoring pairs of records that are co-blocked for similarity, and then matching pairs of sufficient similarity. In the most common case of matching two sources, it is often desirable for the final matching to be one-to-one (a record may be matched with at most one other); members of the database and statistical record linkage communities accomplish such matchings in the final stage by weighted bipartite graph matching on similarity scores. Such matchings are intuitively appealing: they leverage a natural global property of many real-world entity stores-that of being nearly deduped-and are known to provide significant improvements to precision and recall. Unfortunately unlike the bipartite case, exact max-weight matching on multi-partite graphs is known to be NP-hard. Our two-fold algorithmic contributions approximate multi-partite max-weight matching: our first algorithm borrows optimization techniques common to Bayesian probabilistic inference; our second is a greedy approximation algorithm. In addition to a theoretical guarantee on the latter, we present comparisons on a real-world ER problem from Bing significantly larger than typically found in the literature, publication data, and on a series of synthetic problems. Our results quantify significant improvements due to exploiting multiple sources, which are made possible by global one-to-one constraints linking otherwise independent matching sub-problems. We also discover that our algorithms are complementary: one being much more robust under noise, and the other being simple to implement and very fast to run.},

@article{Gori2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a general framework for graph matching which is suitable for different problems of pattern recognition. The pattern representation we assume is at the same time highly structured, like for classic syntactic and structural approaches, and of subsymbolic nature with real-valued features, like for connectionist and statistic approaches. We show that random walk based models, inspired by Google's PageRank, give rise to a spectral theory that nicely enhances the graph topological features at node level. As a straightforward consequence, we derive a polynomial algorithm for the classic graph isomorphism problem, under the restriction of dealing with Markovian spectrally distinguishable graphs (MSD), a class of graphs that does not seem to be easily reducible to others proposed in the literature. The experimental results that we found on different test-beds of the TC-15 graph database show that the defined MSD class "almost always" covers the database, and that the proposed algorithm is significantly more efficient than top scoring VF algorithm on the same data. Most interestingly, the proposed approach is very well-suited for dealing with partial and approximate graph matching problems, derived for instance from image retrieval tasks. We consider the objects of the COIL-100 visual collection and provide a graph-based representation, whose node's labels contain appropriate visual features. We show that the adoption of classic bipartite graph matching algorithms offers a straightforward generalization of the algorithm given for graph isomorphism and, finally, we report very promising experimental results on the COIL-100 visual collection.},

abstract = {Traditional biometric recognition systems rely on a single biometric signature for authentication. While the advantage of using multiple sources of information for establishing the identity has been widely recognized, computational models for multimodal biometrics recognition have only recently received attention. We propose a multimodal sparse representation method, which represents the test data by a sparse linear combination of training data, while constraining the observations from different modalities of the test subject to share their sparse representations. Thus, we simultaneously take into account correlations as well as coupling information among biometric modalities. A multimodal quality measure is also proposed to weigh each modality as it gets fused. Furthermore, we also kernelize the algorithm to handle nonlinearity in data. The optimization problem is solved using an efficient alternative direction method. Various experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with competing fusion-based methods.},
