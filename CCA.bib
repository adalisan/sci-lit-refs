abstract = {Abstract  Data recorded from multiple sources sometimes exhibit non-instantaneous couplings. For simple data sets, cross-correlograms
  may reveal the coupling dynamics. But when dealing with high-dimensional multivariate data there is no such measure as the
  cross-correlogram. We propose a simple algorithm based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (kCCA) that computes a multivariate
  temporal filter which links one data modality to another one. The filters can be used to compute a multivariate extension
  of the cross-correlogram, the canonical correlogram, between data sources that have different dimensionalities and temporal
  resolutions. The canonical correlogram reflects the coupling dynamics between the two sources. The temporal filter reveals
  which features in the data give rise to these couplings and when they do so. We present results from simulations and neuroscientific
  experiments showing that tkCCA yields easily interpretable temporal filters and correlograms. In the experiments, we simultaneously
  performed electrode recordings and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in primary visual cortex of the non-human
  primate. While electrode recordings reflect brain activity directly, fMRI provides only an indirect view of neural activity
  via the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response. Thus it is crucial for our understanding and the interpretation of fMRI
  signals in general to relate them to direct measures of neural activity acquired with electrodes. The results computed by
  tkCCA confirm recent models of the hemodynamic response to neural activity and allow for a more detailed analysis of neurovascular
  coupling dynamics.},

abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classical multivariate method concerned with describing linear dependencies between sets of variables. After a short exposition of the linear sample CCA problem and its analytical solution, the article proceeds with a detailed characterization of its geometry. Projection operators are used to illustrate the relations between canonical vectors and variates. The article then addresses the problem of CCA between spaces spanned by objects mapped into kernel feature spaces. An exact solution for this kernel canonical correlation (KCCA) problem is derived from a geometric point of view. It shows that the expansion coefficients of the canonical vectors in their respective feature space can be found by linear CCA in the basis induced by kernel principal component analysis. The effect of mappings into higher dimensional feature spaces is considered critically since it simplifies the CCA problem in general. Then two regularized variants of KCCA are discussed. Relations to other methods are illustrated, e.g., multicategory kernel Fisher discriminant analysis, kernel principal component regression and possible applications thereof in blind source separation.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to reduce potential statistical barriers and open doors to canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for applied behavioral scientists and personality researchers. CCA was selected for discussion, as it represents the highest level of the general linear model (GLM) and can be rather easily conceptualized as a method closely linked with the more widely understood Pearson r correlation coefficient. An understanding of CCA can lead to a more global appreciation of other univariate and multivariate methods in the GLM. We attempt to demonstrate CCA with basic language, using technical terminology only when necessary for understanding and use of the method. We present an entire example of a CCA analysis using SPSS (Version 11.0) with personality data.},

Our focus is on vector-valued data sources, each consisting of measurements of the same entity but on different variables, and on tasks where source-specific variation is considered noisy or not interesting. Principal components analysis of all sources combined together is an obvious choice if it is not important to distinguish between data source-specific and shared variation. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) focuses on mutual dependencies and discards source-specific "noise" but it produces a separate set of components for each source.},

abstract = {The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is commonly used to analyze data sets with paired data, e.g. measurements of gene expression and metabolomic intensities of the same experiments. This allows to find interesting relationships between the data sets, e.g. they can be assigned to biological processes. However, it can be difficult to interpret the processes and often the relationships observed are not related to the experimental design but to some unknown parameters.   Here we present an extension of the penalized CCA, the supervised penalized approach (spCCA), where the experimental design is used as a third data set and the correlation of the biological data sets with the design data set is maximized to find interpretable and meaningful canonical variables. The spCCA was successfully tested on a data set of Arabidopsis thaliana with gene expression and metabolite intensity measurements and resulted in eight significant canonical variables and their interpretation. We provide an R-package under the GPL license.},
