This is the case in many applications, including kernel principal component analysis (PCA) for signal and image denoising. Unfortunately, it turns out that the reverse mapping generally does not exist and only a few elements in the feature space have a valid preimage in the input space. The preimage problem consists of finding an approximate solution by identifying data in the input space based on their corresponding features in the high dimensional feature space. It is essentially a dimensionality-reduction problem, and both have been intimately connected in their historical evolution, as studied in this article.},

With the exception of prosopagnosics (who are unable to recognize faces) and those suffering from such disorders of social cognition as autism, people are extremely adept at these two tasks. However, our cognitive powers in this regard come at the price of reading too much into the human face. The face is often treated as a window into a person's true nature. Given the agreement in social perception of faces, this paper discusses that it should be possible to model this perception.},

abstract = {Sampling, coding, and streaming even the most essential data, e.g., in medical imaging and weather-monitoring applications, produce a data deluge that severely stresses the avail able analog-to-digital converter, communication bandwidth, and digital-storage resources. Surprisingly, while the ambient data dimension is large in many problems, the relevant information in the data can reside in a much lower dimensional space. This observation has led to several important theoretical and algorithmic developments under different low-dimensional modeling frameworks, such as compressive sensing (CS), matrix completion, and general factor-model representations. These approaches have enabled new measurement systems, tools, and methods for information extraction from dimensionality-reduced or incomplete data. A key aspect of maximizing the potential of such techniques is to develop appropriate data models. In this article, we investigate this challenge from the perspective of nonparametric Bayesian analysis.},

Second, we describe a refinement of the Nystr\"{o}m extension algorithm called "geometric harmonics." We also explain how to use this tool for data assimilation. Finally, we introduce a multicue data matching scheme based on nonlinear spectral graphs alignment. The effectiveness of the presented schemes is validated by applying it to the problems of lipreading and image sequence alignment.},

abstract = {This paper challenges the issue of automatic matching between two image sets with similar intrinsic structures and different appearances, especially when there is no prior correspondence. An unsupervised manifold alignment framework is proposed to establish correspondence between data sets by a mapping function in the mutual embedding space. We introduce a local similarity metric based on parameterized distance curves to represent the connection of one point with the rest of the manifold. A small set of valid feature pairs can be found without manual interactions by matching the distance curve of one manifold with the curve-cluster of the other manifold. To avoid potential confusions in image matching, we propose an extended affine transformation to solve the non-rigid alignment in the embedding space. The comparatively tight alignments and the structure preservation can be obtained simultaneously. The point pairs with the minimum distance after alignment are viewed as the matchings. We apply manifold alignment to image set matching problems. The correspondence between image sets of different poses, illuminations, and identities, can be established effectively by our approach.},

abstract = {This paper is about supervised and semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (DR) by generating spectral embeddings from multi-output data based on the pairwise proximity information. Two flexible and generic frameworks are proposed to achieve supervised DR (SDR) for multilabel classification. One is able to extend any existing single-label SDR to multilabel via sample duplication, referred to as MESD. The other is a multilabel design framework that tackles the SDR problem by computing weight (proximity) matrices based on simultaneous feature and label information, referred to as MOPE, as a generalization of many current techniques. A diverse set of different schemes for label-based proximity calculation, as well as a mechanism for combining label-based and feature-based weight information by considering information importance and prioritization, are proposed for MOPE. Additionally, we summarize many current spectral methods for unsupervised DR (UDR), single/multilabel SDR, and semi-supervised DR (SSDR) and express them under a common template representation as a general guide to researchers in the field. We also propose a general framework for achieving SSDR by combining existing SDR and UDR models, and also a procedure of reducing the computational cost via learning with a target set of relation features. The effectiveness of our proposed methodologies is demonstrated with experiments with document collections for multilabel text categorization from the natural language processing domain.},

abstract = {Measuring image similarity is a central topic in computer vision. In this paper, we propose to measure image similarity by learning from the online Flickr image groups. We do so by: Choosing 103 Flickr groups, building a one-versus-all multiclass classifier to classify test images into a group, taking the set of responses of the classifiers as features, calculating the distance between feature vectors to measure image similarity. Experimental results on the Corel dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features. To build our similarity measure, we need one-versus-all classifiers that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of data. We adopt an SVM classifier with a histogram intersection kernel. We describe a novel fast training algorithm for this classifier: the Stochastic Intersection Kernel MAchine (SIKMA) training algorithm. This method can produce a kernel classifier that is more accurate than a linear classifier on tens of thousands of examples in minutes.},

We identify some distinguishing characteristics of all three libraries, most of them supposedly traceable to the libraries' shared nature of relating to a very specialized domain. Among these characteristics are the presence of a very large strongly connected component in each of the corresponding directed graphs, the complete absence of any clear power laws describing the distribution of local features, and the rise to prominence of some local features (e.g., stress centrality) that can be used to effectively search for keywords in the libraries.},

@article{Wei2011,
abstract = {As it is true for human perception that we gather information from different sources in natural and multi-modality forms, learning from multi-modalities has become an effective scheme for various information retrieval problems. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modality fusion approach for video search, where the search modalities are derived from a diverse set of knowledge sources, such as text transcript from speech recognition, low-level visual features from video frames, and high-level semantic visual concepts from supervised learning. Since the effectiveness of each search modality greatly depends on specific user queries, prompt determination of the importance of a modality to a user query is a critical issue in multi-modality search. Our proposed approach, named concept-driven multi-modality fusion (CDMF), explores a large set of predefined semantic concepts for computing multi-modality fusion weights in a novel way. Specifically, in CDMF, we decompose the query-modality relationship into two components that are much easier to compute: query-concept relatedness and concept-modality relevancy. The former can be efficiently estimated online using semantic and visual mapping techniques, while the latter can be computed offline based on concept detection accuracy of each modality. Such a decomposition facilitates the need of adaptive learning of fusion weights for each user query on-the-fly, in contrast to the existing approaches which mostly adopted predefined query classes and/or modality weights. Experimental results on TREC video-retrieval evaluation 2005-2008 dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the existing multi-modality fusion methods and achieves near-optimal performance (from oracle fusion) for many test queries.},

@article{Fishkind2013,
abstract = {Suppose that two large, high-dimensional data sets are each noisy measurements of the same underlying random process, and principle components analysis is performed separately on the data sets to reduce their dimensionality. In some circumstances it may happen that the two lower-dimensional data sets have an inordinately large Procrustean fitting-error between them. The purpose of this manuscript is to quantify this "incommensurability phenomenon." In particular, under specified conditions, the square Procrustean fitting-error of the two normalized lower-dimensional data sets is (asymptotically) a convex combination (via a correlation parameter) of the Hausdorff distance between the projection subspaces and the maximum possible value of the square Procrustean fitting-error for normalized data. We show how this gives rise to the incommensurability phenomenon, and we employ illustrative simulations to explore how the incommensurability phenomenon may have an appreciable impact.},
